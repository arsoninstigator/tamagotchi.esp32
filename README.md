# tamagotchi made with esp32

made the tamagotchi game using a esp32 microcontroller. i created this when esp32 was still on the list of components for the #bin but by the time i was done, it had been taken off the list. this was initially made in arduino based on [alojz jakob's creation of 'tamaguino'](https://github.com/alojzjakob/Tamaguino) with a [much larger OLED](https://www.instructables.com/Tamaguino-Update-With-Huge-OLED/).


here's a schematic diagram of the setup -

a live simulation of this game can be found on wokwi - [here](https://wokwi.com/projects/406760649085824001)

if it doesn't work, you might have to use wokwi for vscode to run the simulation properly
